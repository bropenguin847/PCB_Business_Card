# Purpose
Designing a unique business card with my personal details for networking.
At the same time, learn how to design my own custom PCB. Such as how to find custom footprints, how to order PCB and so on.
Open Source my results for people to use and for reference in the future.

## Characteristics
1. Have my name, phone number, email address and logo.
2. Have QR codes to my [Github](https://github.com/bropenguin847) and to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lim-yeow-sheng/).
3. Have a ruler for on the spot measuring (centimeter and inch).
4. Have a reference for common SMD Footprints and Traces, as well as their respective details.
